                <h1>SAKAI JIN</h1>
                <p>Jin Sakai is a samurai forced to abandon his honor to fight against the brutal Mongol invasion on Tsushima Island. As "The <span class="ghost-color">Ghost</span>," Jin adopts unconventional fighting techniques that go against the samurai code, such as stealth tactics, poison, and ambushes to instill fear in his enemies. In his role as the <span class="ghost-color">Ghost</span>, Jin inspires the people of Tsushima to resist, embodying the fight for freedom—even if it means sacrificing his status as an honorable samurai.</p>

                <h1>BECOME <span class="ghost-color">GHOST</span></h1>
                <p>The year is 1274. Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan—until the fearsome Mongol Empire invades the island of Tsushima, wreaking havoc and conquering the local population. As one of the last surviving samurai, you rise from the ashes to fight back. But honorable tactics won’t lead you to victory. You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting—the way of the Ghost—as you wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.</p>
